Remove some intrusive Windows updates for Windows 7/8.1, related to telemetry and nag-updating to Windows 10.  

(Protip: ``KB3035583`` is the *"Get Windows 10"* system tray icon you see in Win7/8.1)

**These updates will be reinstalled after a reboot. To get rid of them for good, disable/hide them in Windows Update after uninstall.**
